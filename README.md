# mDirt
## making Datapacks Is Really Tedious

A tool for easily creating custom features using Minecraft Datapacks.
**Only Supported for 1.21.3 and up! No previous versions will be added!**

### About Updates
v1.x of mDirt will not be updated further, at all. I am writing v2.0 right now, but it may take a bit (I am fully refactoring the entire app).

When it does release, it will come with custom recipes for blasting, campfire, etc as well as custom items for block drops, and custom components for custom items!

Thanks for reading my little rant!

## Credits
The tool was made entirely by me, with lots of UI help from @JustJoshinDev.
Some Datapack things, such as the method for creating custom blocks, was developed by others:
