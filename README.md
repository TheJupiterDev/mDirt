## How to use
Download the latest release, and run it.
If you don't understand a field, hover over it and read the tooltip!
Fill in all the details, press "Generate Pack" when you are ready.

## Next Update Details
v1.8.0 will add custom Items to to the program. It will be released with in a week or so (hopefully)

## In Progress

### Known Issues
The break particles are not from the custom block, but from the base block. I sadly cannot do anything about this, it is a limitation in Datapacks.

The tool was made entirely by me and lots of help from @JustJoshinDev, but the method for adding custom blocks was developed by https://youtube.com/@WASDBuildTeam and improved upon by me!
