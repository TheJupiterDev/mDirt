Download the latest release, and run it.
If you don't understand a field, hover over it and read the tooltip!

### Known Issues
Currently, if you create an item with a NON-CUSTOM model, the program will crash. *This is being worked on*

The tool was made entirely by me and lots of help from @JustJoshinDev, but the method for adding custom blocks was developed by https://youtube.com/@WASDBuildTeam and improved upon by me!
