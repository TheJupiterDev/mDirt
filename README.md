### Known Issues
There are no placing sounds, this will be fixed soon.
The tooltips in the app look bad. This is being fixed.
The break particles are not from the custom block, but from the base block. _This will be fixed if possible._

The tool was made entirely by me, but the method for adding custom blocks was developed by https://youtube.com/@WASDBuildTeam and improved upon by me!
